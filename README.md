# ETL-Pipeline
Lender Data Integration & Validation System

## Problem Statement:
Financial and insurance companies receive client data in inconsistent formats with missing fields, invalid values, and unclear business rules. Manual fixes are slow and error-prone. This project simulates a production-style data integration pipeline that ingests lender files, validates and transforms data, tracks quality issues, and delivers analytics for operational decision-making.
